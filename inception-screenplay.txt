DAWN.

CRASHING SURF.

The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand.

He lies there.

A CHILD'S SHOUT makes him LIFT his head to see: a LITTLE
BLONDE BOY crouching, back towards us, watching the tide eat
a SAND CASTLE. A LITTLE BLONDE GIRL joins the boy. The
Bearded Man tries to call to them, but they RUN OFF, FACES
UNSEEN. He COLLAPSES.
The barrel of a rifle ROLLS the Bearded Man onto his back.
A JAPANESE SECURITY GUARD looks down at him, then calls up
the beach to a colleague leaning against a JEEP. Behind
them is a cliff, and on top of that, a JAPANESE CASTLE.

The Security Guard waits as an ATTENDANT speaks to an ELDERLY
JAPANESE MAN sitting at the dining table, back to us.
ATTENDANT
(in Japanese)
He was delirious. But asked for you
by name. And...
(to the Security Guard)
Show him.
SECURITY GUARD
(in Japanese)
He was carrying nothing but this...
He puts a HANDGUN on the table.
...and this.

The Elderly Man keeps eating.

SECURITY GUARD (CONT'D)

The Security Guard places a SMALL PEWTER CONE alongside the
gun. The Elderly Man STOPS eating. Picks up the cone.
ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN
(in Japanese)
Bring him here. And some food.

The Elderly Japanese Man watches the Bearded Man WOLF down
his food. He SLIDES the handgun down the table towards him.

ELDERLY JAPANESE MAN (CONT'D)
I know what this is.
He SPINS it onto the table- it CIRCLES gracefully across the
polished ebony... a SPINNING TOP.
ELDERLY MAN
I've seen one before. Many, many
years ago...
The Elderly Japanese Man STARES at the top, mesmerized.
ELDERLY MAN (CONT'D)

COBB (CONT'D)
Resilient, highly contagious. Once
an idea's taken hold in the brain
it's almost impossible to eradicate.
A person can cover it up, ignore itbut it stays there.
SAITO
But surely- to forget..?
COBB
Information, yes. But an idea? Fully
formed, understood? That sticks...
(taps forehead)
In there, somewhere.
SAITO
For someone like you to steal?
ARTHUR
Yes. In the dream state, conscious
defenses are lowered and your thoughts
become vulnerable to theft. It's
called extraction.
COBB
But, Mr.Saito, we can train your
subconscious to defend itself from
even the most skilled extractor.
SAITO
How can you do that?
COBB
Because I am the most skilled
extractor. I know how to search
your mind and find your secrets. I
know the tricks, and I can teach
them to your subconscious so that
even when you're asleep, your guard
is never down.

Cobb leans forward, holding Saito's gaze.
COBB (CONT'D)
But if I'm going to help you, you
have to be completely open with me.
I'll need to know my way around your
thoughts better than your wife, your
analyst, anyone.
(gestures around)
If this is a dream and you've got a
safe full of secrets, I need to know
what's in that safe. For this to
work, you have to let me in.
Saito gives this a flicker of a smile. Rises. A BODYGUARD
opens double doors which give on to a LAVISH PARTY.

Cobb, ASLEEP, SITTING IN A CHAIR AT THE END OF A STEAMING
BATH. The chair is up on a cabinet- the bottom of the legs
level with the rim of the tub.
A sweating man (40's) watches over Cobb. This is NASH. A
distant EXPLOSION rumbles through the room. Nash moves to
the window, parts the curtains. Outside: a CHAOTIC DEVELOPINGWORLD CITY- the street filled with RIOTERS- SMASHING, BURNING.
Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds
TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watchTHE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY.
Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's
feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the
briefcase to Arthur's wrist.
Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where
they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack
of the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running
to his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and weCUT TO:

checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE
OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO.
Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME.

Other GUESTS wander the massive terraces.
Saito knows.

ARTHUR
He's playing with us.

COBB
I can get it here. The information's
in the safe- he looked right at it
when I mentioned secrets.
Arthur nods.

Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder.

Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS
patrolling the castle at ground level.
COBB
Actually, Mr.Saito is partial to
postwar British painters.
He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves.
COBB (CONT'D)
Would you sit down?
Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wing back chair.
Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels
at Mal's feet. She looks down at him.
Tell me...

MAL

Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS.
MAL (CONT'D)
Do the children miss me?
Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's
ankle. He looks up at her.
COBB
You can't imagine.
Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting
out the rope as he moves back to the window.

HALFWAY down the length of the table.
SAITO
Now the envelope, Mr.Cobb.
Cobb reaches into his waistband, removes ONE of the envelopes,
SLIDES it along the table. Steps back, hands raised.
COBB
Did she tell you, or have you known
all along?
SAITO
That you're here to steal from me?

Or that we're actually asleep?
Arthur gives Cobb an I-told-you-so look.
SAITO (CONT'D)
I want to know who your employer is.
Mal COCKS the gun at Arthur's temple.
COBB
No point threatening him in a dream.
MAL
That depends on what you're
threatening. Killing him would just
wake him up... but pain? Pain is in
the mind...
Mal LOWERS the gun and SHOOTS Arthur in the leg- Arthur drops,
SCREAMING- Mal looks at Cobb, cold.
MAL (CONT'D)
And, judging by the decor, we're in
your mind, aren't we, Arthur?
Cobb watches Arthur's PAIN.

Mal aims at Arthur's other leg...

Cobb SPRINGS for the table, SKIDDING along its polished

Saito's BODYGUARD offers Cobb a GUN.
SAITO (CONT'D)
So I offer you the satisfaction.
COBB
That's not how I deal with things.
SAITO
Would you work with him again?
Cobb shakes his head. Saito's BODYGUARDS PULL Nash from the
chopper. Saito motions Cobb and Arthur to sit. The chopper
RISES. Cobb watches Nash DRAGGED across the pad.
COBB
What will you do to him?
SAITO
Nothing. But I can't speak for your
friends from Cobol Engineering.
Saito looks out at the city slipping by.
COBB
What do you want from us?
Inception.

Arthur raises his eyebrows.

Cobb is poker-faced.

Elephants.

ARTHUR
Right. But it's not your idea because
you know I gave it to you.
SAITO
You could plant it subconsciouslyARTHUR
The subject's mind can always trace
the genesis of the idea. True
inspiration is impossible to fake.
COBB
No, it isn't.
SAITO
Can you do it?
COBB
I won't do it.
SAITO
In exchange, I'll give you the
information you were paid to steal.

Are you giving me a choice? Because
I can find my own way to square things

COBB
Be realistic, Stephen. They'd never

throw away the key. Or worse.
MILES
You think what you're doing now is
helping your case?
COBB
Lawyers don't pay for themselves.
This is what I have. This is what
you taught me.
MILES
I never taught you to be a thief.
COBB
No, you taught me to navigate other
people's minds. But after what

I mastered the dream share I'd have
a whole new way of creating and
showing people my creations. You
told me it would free me.
Miles looks at Cobb, sad.
MILES
And I'm sorry. I was wrong.
COBB
No, you weren't. Your vision was a
vision of pure creativity. It's
where we took it that was wrong.
MILES
And now you want me to let someone
else follow you into fantasy.
COBB
They won't actually come on the job,
they'll just design the levels and
teach them to the dreamers.
MILES
Design them yourself.
COBB
Mal won't let me.
Miles looks at Cobb.

Appalled.

MILES
Come back to reality, Dom.

Please.

COBB
You want to know what's real, Stephen?
Your grandchildren waiting for their
dad to come back. This job- this

I wouldn't be standing here if there
were any other way. I can get home.

They're projections of my

Yours?

ARIADNE

COBB
Sure- you are the dreamer, I am the

your world. That's one way we get
at a subject's thoughts- his mind
creates the people, so we can
literally talk to his subconscious.

How else do you do it?

Architecture. Build a bank vault or
a jail, something secure, and the
subject's mind will fill it with

Saito-San, when you wake you might

The truth that as we go deeper into

INT./EXT. VAN INTO RIVER -- DAY

273

-THE WATER, THE VAN CRUNCHING WITH THE IMPACT- WATER CRASHING
THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDOWS FLOODING THE INTERIOR...
Fischer's EYES OPEN, PANICKING- he UNBUCKLES HIMSELF, pushes
out of the broken window- STOPS, goes back to UNBUCKLE
Browning and DRAG him out274

EXT. RIVER -- CONTINUOUS

274

Fischer breaks the surface with Browning, who COUGHS and
GASPS. He starts PULLING for the near bank, struggling
through the rain-impacted water275

INT. VAN, UNDERWATER -- CONTINUOUS

275

Ariadne, Arthur and Yusuf wait calmly underwater. They are
sharing TWO REGULATORS pulled from beneath the front seat.
Arthur he turns to Saito. There is blood in the water around
Saito's belly- his eyes are LIFELESS- Arthur feels for a
pulse... turns to Cobb, whose eyes are lifeless... Ariadne
GRABS Arthur's elbow, pulling him away...
276

EXT. RIVERBANK -- MOMENTS LATER
Fischer turns Browning/Eames over.

276
They lie there, exhausted.

BROWNING
I'm sorry, Robert.
Fischer stares at the rain on the water.
FISCHER
The will means that Dad wanted me to
be my own man, not live for him.
(turns to Browning)
And I'm going to, Uncle Peter.
Browning nods. Wipes the rain from his face. In the puddle
beside them, the reflection is not Browning, but Eames.

EXT. UNDERNEATH BRIDGE IN THE RAIN -- MOMENTS LATER
Arthur sits on the riverbank, breathing heavily.

ARIADNE
He'll be alright.

And weCUT TO:
278

EXT. DAWN.

CRASHING SURF.

The waves TOSS a BEARDED MAN onto wet sand.
As the Japanese Security Guard turns him onto his back, we
realize that this is Cobb- OLDER. WEARY. TRAVELED...
279

INT. DINING ROOM, CASTLE -- DAY

279

Cobb WOLFS his food. The Elderly Japanese Man (Saito, ninety
years old) watches him.
SAITO
So... have you come to kill me?
Cobb does not look up.
SAITO (CONT'D)
I've been waiting for someone to
come for me...
COBB
Someone from your half-remembered
dream..?
Saito peers at Cobb.
SAITO
Cobb? Not possible- he and I were
young men together. And I am an old
man...
COBB
Filled with regret?
Saito REMEMBERS, nods...

SAITO
Waiting to die alone, yes.

Cobb is STARING at something on the table.
COBB
I came back for you... I came to
remind you of what you once knew...
Cobb gestures at the table. Saito follows his gaze down to
the polished surface of the table...
COBB (CONT'D)
That this world is not real.
The top is still SPINNING PERFECTLY, AS IF IT WILL NEVER
TOPPLE. Saito looks at the top. Then back to Cobb.
SAITO
You came to convince me to honour
our arrangement?
Yes.

COBB
And to take a leap of faith.

As Saito-san listens to Cobb he looks at the GUN on the table
between them...
COBB (CONT'D)
Come back and we'll be young men
together again.
The Elderly Saito looks at Cobb.

Nods.

And weCUT TO:

Ariadne watches Cobb.

His eyes are closed.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.)
Hot towel, sir?
His EYES FLICKER OPEN. He takes the towel with a nod.
Ariadne smiles. Relieved.
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (CONT'D)
We'll be landing in Los Angeles in
about twenty minutes. Do you need
immigration forms?
Cobb nods.

Takes a landing card.

Looks around the cabin.

Saito is WATCHING him. Serious. Haunted. Holding Cobb's
gaze, SAITO PICKS UP THE PHONE AND DIALS. Cobb nods thanks...
281

INT. ARRIVALS, LAX -- LATER

281

Cobb steps forward to the IMMIGRATION OFFICIAL. Hands him
his passport. Nervous. The Official takes a beat, looks
Cobb up and down, then WHUMP!- the passport is stamped. As
Cobb takes it back he spots Ariadne at the next counter.
She nods at him. He nods back. Then moves off...
As Cobb passes through baggage claim he exchanges subtle
greetings with Eames and Yusuf.

Arthur smiles broadly at Cobb. Cobb brushes past Fischer,
who glances back at him as if thinking maybe he should know
him, then moves on...
As Cobb emerges into the crowded Arrivals Hall, he spots
Professor Miles, waving at him...
282

INT. KITCHEN, COBB AND MAL'S HOUSE -- DAY
Cobb enters with Miles. Drops his bags. Moves to the table,
looking out at the overgrown garden. He reaches into his
pocket, takes out his pewter spinning top, lowers it to the
table and SPINS IT- a CHILD'S SHOUT makes him look upThrough the window, James and Philippa have run into view,
playing, THEIR FACES TURNED AWAY... Cobb STARES at the back
of his children's heads... Miles moves to the window and
KNOCKS on the glassJames and Philippa TURN- see their Dad. He steps to the
window, watching their BRIGHT FACES SHINING as they run
towards him...
Behind him, on the table, the spinning top is STILL SPINNING.
And weFADE OUT.
